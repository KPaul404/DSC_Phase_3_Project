    "# Project Overview\n",
    "***SyriaTel Customer Churn***\n",
    "\n",
    "The project strategically harnesses data analytics and machine learning to augment customer experiences and reduce churn for Syriatel, a leading telecommunications provider in Syria. In an intensely competitive market, Syriatel's sustained growth hinges on customer retention and satisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Understanding\n",
    "#### 1.1 Introduction to Syriatel\n",
    "Syriatel is a mobile network provider in Syria that was founded in 2000. It is one of the two dominant providers in the country, along with MTN Syria. Syriatel offers LTE, 3G, and GSM services to its customers, under the brand name Super Surf. The company is owned by Rami Makhlouf, a cousin of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and has about 3,500 employees and 8 million subscribers. Syriatel is headquartered in Damascus and operates in all Syrian governorates. However, the company has faced several challenges in recent years, such as the European Union sanctions, the Syrian civil war, and the judicial custody order issued by a Syrian court in 2020. Syriatel is also facing competition from a new entrant, Wafa Telecom, which received the third telecom license in Syria in 2022. Syriatel faces the imperative challenge of evolving and enhancing its services. This evolution is crucial to maintain its competitive edge and continue providing exceptional customer experiences in a rapidly changing market.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Key Stakeholders\n",
    "My stakeholders are: (1) Executives, (2) Customer Retention Team, and (3) Potential Investors and Partners of  'SyriaTel' where I'm a lead datascientist The project's success is deeply connected to meeting the needs and expectations of a varied group of stakeholders, each with distinct interests and objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### A.\tSyriatel:\n",
    "1. **Syriatel Executives**: The company's leadership is focused on sustaining and growing the customer base. Their strategic objectives encompass ensuring the long-term prosperity and market dominance of Syriatel, amidst increasing competition and evolving market demands.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Syriatel Customer Retention Team**: Tasked with bolstering customer acquisition and retention, the marketing department is keen on enhancing customer engagement. They are responsible for devising and implementing targeted promotional campaigns and strategies to attract and retain customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### B.\tPotential Investors and Partners: \n",
    "While not directly involved in day-to-day operations, investors and business partners have a vested interest in Syriatel's market performance and strategic direction. Their support and investment are essential for funding new initiatives and driving technological advancements.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Business Problem\n",
    "We lack the ability to identify customers when they're on the cusp of churning (**Churn ~ loss of customers to competition**). The objective of this project is to predict likely churners. Our dataset includes 20 variables describing over 3,000 current and churned customers. Achieving this predictive ability will allow us to examine the data on a rolling basis and quickly implement targeted incentivization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "The project is aligned with the following key objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Churn Prediction and Mitigation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Train, test, and evaluate advanced classification models to accurately predict customer churn.\n",
    "    2. Leverage predictive insights to identify customers at risk of churn, facilitating proactive retention strategies.\n",
    "    3. Use model outputs to develop targeted interventions, mitigating churn and enhancing customer loyalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\t**Customer Experience Enhancement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Utilize insights derived from machine learning models to understand customer needs and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Implement data-driven recommendations to improve customer satisfaction, such as personalized services and prompt issue resolution.\n",
    "    3. Ensure high network performance and service quality, fostering a positive and consistent customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\t**Strategic Business Decision Making**:\n",
    "    1. Apply the findings from the final model to inform and support key business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Develop and execute strategies that not only retain existing customers but also attract new ones, strengthening Syriatel’s market position.\n",
    "    3. Craft innovative solutions and services based on customer data insights, ensuring Syriatel remains competitive and responsive to market dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "By focusing on these objectives, the project aims to empower Syriatel with actionable data-driven insights, reinforcing its market presence and customer-centric approach. The integration of machine learning into business strategies is envisioned to transform customer interactions and decision-making processes, setting new standards for excellence in the telecommunications industry.\n"
