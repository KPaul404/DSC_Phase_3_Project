    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "#### 1.1 Introduction to Syriatel\n",
    "Syriatel is a mobile network provider in Syria that was founded in 2000. It is one of the two dominant providers in the country, along with MTN Syria. Syriatel offers LTE, 3G, and GSM services to its customers, under the brand name Super Surf. The company is owned by Rami Makhlouf, a cousin of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and has about 3,500 employees and 8 million subscribers. Syriatel is headquartered in Damascus and operates in all Syrian governorates. However, the company has faced several challenges in recent years, such as the European Union sanctions, the Syrian civil war, and the judicial custody order issued by a Syrian court in 2020. Syriatel is also facing competition from a new entrant, Wafa Telecom, which received the third telecom license in Syria in 2022. Syriatel faces the imperative challenge of evolving and enhancing its services. This evolution is crucial to maintain its competitive edge and continue providing exceptional customer experiences in a rapidly changing market.\n",
